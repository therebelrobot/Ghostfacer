# Ghostfacer!
A multi-mode ghost detection device, written in TinyGo for Seeeduino Xiao BLE 👻 🔍 - EMF detector / FM Scanner / Ovilus+ / EVP detector

## Is this a joke?
As much a joke as having a working multimode device can be. It detects EMF changes, it scans FM stations, it corresponds environmental changes to English words, and tries to interpret sound as English words. Does the detection of any of that indicate metaphysical presence? Not a clue, but it's a fun date night, at least.
